## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Blinkit's sales data using Power BI. The goal is to gain insights into sales performance, product categories, outlet characteristics, and customer preferences. The insights drawn from this analysis aim to assist in strategic decision-making for improving sales and operational efficiency.

## Dataset Information
The dataset includes the following key attributes:

- Item Fat Content: Classification of items into 'Regular' or 'Low Fat'.
- Item Identifier: Unique identifiers for each product.
- Item Type: Categories such as Fruits and Vegetables, Health and Hygiene, Frozen Foods, etc.
- Outlet Establishment Year: The year when each outlet was established.
- Outlet Identifier: Unique codes for each retail outlet.
- Outlet Location Type: Categorization of outlet locations (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).
- Outlet Size: Size classification of outlets (Small, Medium, High).
- Outlet Type: Type of outlets, such as Supermarket Type1 or Type2.
- Item Visibility: Visibility score of items within the store.
- Item Weight: The weight of each item.
- Sales: Recorded sales figures for the items.
- Rating: Customer ratings for the items.
## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:

1. Sales Performance Analysis: Analyzing overall sales performance across different product categories, outlets, and regions.
2. Outlet Analysis: Understanding how different types and sizes of outlets perform in terms of sales.
3. Product Insights: Identifying the best-selling products and understanding trends related to item types and visibility.
4. Customer Preferences: Analyzing customer ratings to understand satisfaction and preferences.
## Tools and Technologies Used
- Power BI: For creating interactive and insightful visualizations.
- Excel/CSV: Used for initial data preparation and cleaning.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): To create calculated measures and columns for deeper insights.
- Power Query: Utilized for data transformation and normalization.
## Visualizations Created
The project includes several dashboards and visualizations:

- **Fat Content Analysis**: Visualization showing the relationship between item fat content (Regular vs. Low Fat) and total sales.
- **Item Type Analysis**: Breakdown of total sales by different item types, highlighting which categories contribute the most to sales.
- **Fat Content by Outlet Analysis**: Comparison of sales performance for different fat content items across various outlets.
- **Outlet Establishment Year Analysis**: Sales trends based on the year of establishment of outlets, to see if newer outlets perform differently compared to older ones.
- **Outlet Size Analysis**: Analysis of sales performance based on outlet size (Small, Medium, High).
- **Outlet Location Analysis**: Sales distribution across different outlet locations (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).
- **Outlet Type Analysis**: Sales performance comparison across different types of outlets (e.g., Supermarket Type1, Type2).
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Total Sales, Average Sales, No. of Items, Average Rating.
